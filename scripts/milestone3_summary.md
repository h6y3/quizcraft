# Milestone 3: Question Extraction & Validation Implementation

## Overview

This milestone focused on implementing pattern-based question extraction from PDF files, with AI-based fallback for when pattern matching isn't sufficient. We've designed and implemented a robust system for identifying, extracting, and validating multiple-choice questions from educational content.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Question Models

- `Question` class representing a multiple-choice question with:
  - Question text
  - Options (as a dictionary)
  - Correct answer
  - Explanation
  - Source information
  - Difficulty and category

- `QuestionSet` class for managing collections of questions

### 2. Pattern-Based Question Extraction

- `QuestionExtractor` class implementing:
  - Regex-based pattern matching for question text
  - Multiple option format detection (A,B,C or 1,2,3 formats)
  - Correct answer identification
  - Question grouping and structure parsing

### 3. Question Validation

- `QuestionValidator` class providing:
  - Structure validation (required fields, format)
  - Quality checks (question length, option count)
  - Common issue fixing (adding missing question marks, standardizing formats)

### 4. Question Storage

- `QuestionStorage` class for:
  - SQLite-based persistence
  - CRUD operations for questions
  - Filtering by metadata (category, difficulty, source)
  - Statistics collection

### 5. Service Layer

- `QuestionService` class that:
  - Coordinates extraction, validation, and storage
  - Provides AI-based fallback extraction when pattern matching isn't sufficient
  - Offers statistics and question set creation

## System Design

The system follows a service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **PDF Extractor** provides text segments with metadata
2. **Question Extractor** identifies and structures questions using pattern matching
3. **Validator** ensures questions meet quality standards
4. **AI Service** provides fallback extraction for complex formats
5. **Storage** provides persistence and retrieval capabilities

## Testing

We've implemented:

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration test script for end-to-end testing
- Debug utilities for pattern matching fine-tuning

## Next Steps

For the next milestone (Question Generation), we can build on this foundation by:

1. Using the same validation and storage systems for generated questions
2. Leveraging pattern-matched questions to inform AI-generated questions
3. Implementing topic/concept detection to generate questions around key concepts
4. Adding difficulty calibration for generated questions

## Usage Example

```python
# Extract text from PDF
extractor = PDFExtractor(use_ocr_fallback=True)
segments = extractor.extract_text(pdf_path)
processed_segments = segment_text(segments)

# Extract questions using pattern matching with AI fallback
service = QuestionService(use_ai_fallback=True)
questions, stats = service.extract_questions_from_segments(
    processed_segments, 
    source_file=pdf_path
)

# Get statistics
question_stats = service.get_question_stats(source_file=pdf_path)

# Create a balanced question set for a quiz
question_set = service.create_question_set(
    difficulties=["easy", "medium", "hard"],
    source_file=pdf_path,
    count=10
)
```
